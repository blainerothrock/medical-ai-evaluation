as but not limited to, skin outline, targets and organs-at-risk. it also provides functionalities to create simple geometric treatment plans. contours, images and treatment plans can subsequently be exported to a treatment planning system. the software combines the following digital image processing and visualization tools: \uf0a7 multi-modality viewing and contouring of anatomical, functional, and multi-parametric images such as but not limited to ct, pet, pet/ct, mri, linac cone beam ct (cbct) images \uf0a7 multiplanar reconstruction (mpr) thin/thick, minimum intensity projection (mip), volume rendering technique (vrt) \uf0a7 freehand and semi-automatic contouring of regions-of-interest on any orientation including oblique \uf0a7 automated contouring on ct images \uf0a7 creation of contours on images supported by the application without prior assignment of a planning ct \uf0a7 manual and semi-automatic registration using rigid and deformable registration \uf0a7 supports the user in comparing, contouring, and adapting contours based on datasets acquired with different imaging modalities and at different time points \uf0a7 supports multi-modality image fusion \uf0a7 visualization and contouring of moving tumors and organs \uf0a7 management of points of interest including but not limited to the isocenter \uf0a7 creation of simple geometric treatment plans \uf0a7
